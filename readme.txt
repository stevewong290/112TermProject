This project is a Monopoly game with most features that can be found in the classic version. There will be an AI that allows you to play with a computer that controls buying properties and homes.I have three modes: Two players, One player vs. AI, and AI vs. AI. In the two-player mode, two people play on the same keyboard and take turns rolling the dice, buying property, and building homes. In the One player vs. AI mode, one player will be playing, and every time the player ends their turn, then the AI will then play the turn doing the necessary calculations and deciding what to do. 

For detailed instructions, please press 'h'. It will bring you to the help screen that will answer all the questions.Shortcuts:Shortcuts exist in the One Player vs. AI mode:      You can press ‘o’ in order to give some properties to player 1. This will demonstrate how the AI calculates critical values along with building homes. This will also help accelerate the game after building houses to get the AI to potentially lose.       You can press ‘j’ to send both players to jail. This will show you that after 3 turns, they are let out. Also, if either player ends up rolling a double, they will be allowed to leave the jail.             You can press ‘c’ to give properties to the computer. This will demonstrate how the computer will balance the critical money level and buying houses.       You can press ‘h’ to see the instructionsHow to work with the AI vs. AI mode:There is a start button, and after that, pressing ‘next step’ will allow the user to see what happens next.
